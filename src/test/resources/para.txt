After creating the connection assessment partitions, you can use the AutoGen
/startGUI command to start the graphcal user interface to perform connection
assessment. Avoid using the AutoGenx command with no options. For black box
designs, you apply different connection rules to the paths in the partition and
adjust the number of inductors and memristors on a bus to reduce parametric
variation.
